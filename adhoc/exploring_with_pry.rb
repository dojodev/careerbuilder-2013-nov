# This is a lesson about how to use Pry.
# Pry is a REPL and it can be used in place of IRB.
#
# This file contains two things.  First, this tiny
# bit of ruby code:
require 'pry'

def log(message, number)
  foo(message)
end

def foo(message)
  local_to_foo = "only in foo"
  binding.pry
  "done with foo"
end

log("hello", 1000)

# and then a transcript of a pry session, which follows down below.
#
# You can use this file in one of two ways:
# 1. You can look at the ruby code above and then try to decipher
#    the transcript below.
# OR
# 2. You can run this file (which will throw you into your own
#    pry session) and then explore by typing pry commands
#    yourself, using the transcript below as a starting
#    point.
#
# To run the code, cd to the root of this project and type:
#   > bundle install
#   > ruby adhoc/exploring_with_pry.rb
#
# This will start a pry session in your terminal window. Now you can
# enter pry commands.
#
# The transcipt below is a record of a past pry session; it interleaves
# the commands I typed with the responses that came back from Pry.
#
# My personal pry prompt is set to '[n]>' (where n shows line number)
# so the first line that I actually typed looks like this:
#   [1]> local_to_foo
#
# If you want to exactly reproduce my session scan the transcript for
# the commands I typed (ie, find lines that start with '[n]>' and
# type the same command in your own session.
#
# There are many more pry commands, see:
#   http://pryrepl.org/pry/
